HTSEngineAPI is a wrapper of [hts_engine_API](http://hts-engine.sourceforge.net/) that provides speech waveform synthesis from Hidden Markov Models (HMMs)trained by the [HMM-based speech synthesis system (HTS)](http://hts.sp.nitech.ac.jp/).

**NOTE**: This wrapper is based on a modified version of hts_engine_API [(r9y9/hts_engine_API)](https://github.com/r9y9/hts_engine_API).
